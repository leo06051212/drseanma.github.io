[Sean Longyu Ma](https://profiles.auckland.ac.nz/sean-ma) is a Lecturer in the School of Computer Science.
Sean received his Bachelor's degree (Communication) from Harbin Engineering University in 2010, his Master's degree in Integrated Circuit from Shanghai Jiao Tong University in 2016, and his PhD from the University of Auckland in 2023.
Sean has almost ten years of industrial experience, working as an FPGA & integrated circuit design engineer. 
His research areas are as follows: 
1. Digital design using FPGA platforms
1. RISC-V core customization, including sub-system integration or customized instructions. 
1. The algorithm (not subject to Error correction codes) implementation using parallel computing devices such as FPGAs. 
1. High-level Synthesis design using FPGAs

He is actively looking for driven individuals interested in working toward a PhD or research-based Master's degree under his supervision. Applicants are preferrable to have a solid background in CS/EE, particularly FPGA/GPU, circuits and systems, machine learning and a strong interest in integrative cross-disciplinary projects.
