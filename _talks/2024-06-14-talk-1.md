We have developed a home-grown teaching tool, WebVM, for operating system courses. WebVM provides students instant access to an Ubuntu Linux operating system in their browser. Students have full admin access to the OS, allowing them to develop system kernel modules. Other related products such as Flexit or Coderunner won't allow this.  For SOFTENG 370 in 2024 Sem 1, we received overwhelmingly positive feedback (4.43) from the students. Many praised the effectiveness of WebVM in helping them learn important operating system concepts and practical system development skills. Students particularly enjoyed one assignment, which involved creating a Linux kernel module to control a virtual LED panel and draw a picture they like.
